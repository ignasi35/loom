/**
 * A scope in which {@link Fiber}s are scheduled with support for cancellation,
 * deadlines, and reaping of terminated fibers.
 *
 * <p> A {@code FiberScope} is created and <em>entered</em> by invoking one of
 * the static methods defined by this class. It is <em>exited</em> by invoking
 * its {@linkplain #close() close} method. A scope can only be exited when all
 * fibers scheduled in the scope have terminated and thus the {@code close}
 * method blocks until all fibers scheduled in the scope have terminated.
 * As a special case, fibers can be scheduled in the {@linkplain #DETACHED
 * DETACHED} scope for cases where fibers are <em>unmanaged</em> or need to
 * <em>outlive</em> the thread or fiber that scheduled them.
 *
 * <p> {@code FiberScope} implements {@linkplain AutoCloseable} so that the
 * try-with-resources statement can be used to ensure that a scope is exited.
 * The following example schedules two fibers in a scope. The try-with-resources
 * statement completes when the block completes and both fibers scheduled in the
 * scope terminate.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     Fiber<?> fiber1, fiber2;
 *     try (var scope = FiberScope.cancellable()) {
 *         fiber1 = scope.schedule(() -> { ... });
 *         fiber1 = scope.schedule(() -> { ... });
 *     });
 *     assertFalse(fiber1.isAlive());
 *     assertFalse(fiber2.isAlive());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p> Fiber scopes support cancellation. Fibers test for cancellation by invoking
 * the {@linkplain Fiber#cancelled()} method. If a {@code Fiber} executing in
 * a scope is cancelled then all fibers scheduled in the scope are cancelled.
 * As a special case for cleanup and recovery operations, the {@linkplain
 * #notCancellable} method creates and enters a scope that <em>shields</em> a
 * fiber from cancellation. {@code Fiber.cancelled()} always returns {@code false}
 * when running in a <em>non-cancelable</em> scope.
 *
 * <p> Fiber scopes support deadlines and timeouts. The {@linkplain
 * #withDeadline(Instant) withDeadline} method enters a fiber scope that cancels
 * the fiber in the scope, and all fibers scheduled in the scope, when the deadline
 * expires. The {@linkplain #withTimeout(Duration) withTimeout} is similar for
 * cases where a timeout is used.
 *
 * <p> Fiber scopes may be nested. A thread or fiber executing in a scope may
 * enter another nested scope. Any fibers scheduled in the inner scope must
 * terminate to allow the thread or fiber exit back to the outer scope. Cancellation
 * propagates when cancellable scopes are nested. Fiber scopes using deadlines
 * and timeouts may also be nested.
 *
 * <p> A fiber scope has a {@linkplain #terminationQueue() terminationQueue}.
 * Fibers scheduled in a scope are queued when they terminate so that the owner
 * (usually) can obtain the result of the task that the fiber executed.
 * The termination queue can be disabled with the {@linkplain #disableTerminationQueue()
 * disableTerminationQueue} method for cases where results are not needed or
 * where fibers communicate by other means.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument will cause a
 * {@linkplain NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * The following example is a method that schedules a fiber for each task
 * specified to the method. It returns the result of the first task that completes,
 * cancelling and waiting for any outstanding fibers to terminate before it
 * returns.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     <V> V anyOf(Callable<? extends V>[] tasks) throws Throwable {
 *         try (var scope = FiberScope.cancellable()) {
 *             Arrays.stream(tasks).forEach(task -> scope.schedule(task));
 *             try {
 *                 return (V) scope.terminationQueue().take().join();
 *             } catch (CompletionException e) {
 *                 throw e.getCause();
 *             } finally {
 *                 // cancel any fibers that are still running
 *                 scope.fibers().forEach(Fiber::cancel);
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 * An alternative for this example would be to use {@link Fiber#toFuture()} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture#anyOf CompletableFuture.anyOf(...)}
 * to wait for one of the tasks to complete.
 *
 * <p> The following extends this example to return the result of the first
 * <em>successful</em> task. If no task succeeds then it throws the exception
 * from the first unsuccessful task to complete. This method creates and enters
 * the scope with a deadline so that all fibers are cancelled if the deadline
 * expires before a result is returned.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     <V> V anySuccessful(Callable<? extends V>[] tasks, Instant deadline) throws Throwable {
 *         try (var scope = FiberScope.withDeadline(deadline)) {
 *             Arrays.stream(tasks).forEach(task -> scope.schedule(task));
 *             Throwable firstException = null;
 *             while (scope.hasRemaining()) {
 *                 try {
 *                     V result = (V) scope.terminationQueue().take().join();
 *                     // cancel any fibers that are still running
 *                     scope.fibers().forEach(Fiber::cancel);
 *                     return result;
 *                 } catch (CompletionException e) {
 *                     if (firstException == null) {
 *                         firstException = e.getCause();
 *                     }
 *                 }
 *             }
 *             throw firstException;
 *         }
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p> The following is a more complicated example. The method is called with
 * an array of socket addresses and returns a SocketChannel connected to one
 * of the addresses. The connection attempts are staggered. A fiber is scheduled
 * to connect to the first socket address and if the connection is not
 * established within a certain time then another fiber is scheduled to try to
 * connect to the next socket address. The staggered attempts continue until a
 * connection is established, none of the connections succeed, or the deadline
 * is reached. In the event that several connections are established then all
 * but one are closed so that the method does not leak resources.
 * <pre>{@code
 *     SocketChannel connectAny(SocketAddress[] addresses,
 *                              Instant deadline,
 *                              Duration staggerInterval) throws Exception {
 *         assert addresses.length > 0;
 *
 *         SocketChannel channel = null;
 *         Exception exception = null;
 *
 *         try (var scope = FiberScope.withDeadline(deadline)) {
 *
 *             // schedule a fiber to connect to the first address
 *             Fiber.schedule(scope, () -> SocketChannel.open(addresses[0]));
 *
 *             int next = 1; // index of next address to try
 *
 *             var realDeadline = FiberScope.currentDeadline().orElseThrow();
 *             Duration waitTime = staggerInterval;
 *
 *             while (scope.hasRemaining()) {
 *
 *                 // wait for a timeout or a fiber to terminate
 *                 Fiber<?> fiber = scope.terminationQueue().poll(waitTime);
 *                 if (fiber != null) {
 *                     try {
 *                         SocketChannel ch = (SocketChannel) fiber.join();
